# Image shrinker

Hacky image shrinker done in "ruby" (backtics everywhere)

Uses image magic to remove EXIF data and recompress images. Put images into the input folder, execute run.sh and new images will be generated in shrunk folder. 

DOESNT like spaces in file names
DOESNT do recussive folders.
